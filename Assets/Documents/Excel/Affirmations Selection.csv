I believe something wonderful can happen today
I can do this
I can do this thing called life. I've got this.
I am amazing. I can do anything. I choose to be positive. I know my worth. I will succeed.
I am a positive person and I will continue to be a positive person no matter what happens today
I am worth it
I am worthy
I trust myself to make good choices
I trust myself to make the best decisions I can with the information I have
I am a work in progress and I am ok
I am OK with doing my best
I choose love
"When I am overwhelmed I will breath deeply, step back and observe what is happening"
I am strong
I am worth listening to
I am kind. I am loving. I am loveable.
I am enough
"I am enough, I am more than enough, I am equal to anything I choose to be"
Every day in every way I get better and better
I am having a positive and inspiring impact on the people I come into contact with every moment of every day
I am constantly growing and evolving into a better person
Iâ€™m freeing myself from all destructive doubt and fear
Note to self: I am going to make you so proud
"Happiness is a choice, and today I choose to be happy"
I embrace change seamlessly and rise to the new opportunities it presents
"I have come farther than I would have ever thought possible, and I'm learning along the way"
"I strive for joy, not for perfection"
"When I release shame, I move into myself more beautifully."
Every day in every way I will speak to myself as a friend would
I am surrounded by abundance everywhere
"I am a healthy, energetic and optimistic being"
"I am overflowing with happiness, joy and satisfaction"
My body is relaxed. My mind is calm. My soul is at peace.
Everything I seek can be found within
